title: Which method should I choose?
---

We have created three guides for deploying BlueDragon: baremetal, Docker, and Kubernetes.

- Use the [baremetal guide](/deployment/baremetal) if you want the easiest deployment type. All services run directly on the host machine without any VMs or containers.
- Use the [Docker deployment guide](/deployment/docker) if you want to deploy with Docker. This is a good middle ground between baremetal and Kubernetes.
- Use the [Kubernetes deployment guide](/deployment/kubernetes) if you want to use Agones on a Kubernetes cluster. This method is the most resilient and recommended for production deployments, but it is the most complicated to set up.
