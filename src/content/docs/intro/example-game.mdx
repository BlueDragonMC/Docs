Exploring the example game is the best way to get started with BlueDragon software.
This guide will break down the [main class](https://github.com/BlueDragonMC/ExampleGame/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/com/bluedragonmc/games/examplegame/ExampleGame.kt)
and the necessary [configuration file](https://github.com/BlueDragonMC/ExampleGame/blob/main/src/main/resources/game.properties).

## Configuration File

```properties
# The game.properties file defines the game's main class (which extends com.bluedragonmc.server.Game)
# It is used by the plugin loader to determine which class to instantiate when a game is requested.
# The name is also used to populate menus and command completion.
name=ExampleGame
main-class=com.bluedragonmc.games.examplegame.ExampleGame
```
