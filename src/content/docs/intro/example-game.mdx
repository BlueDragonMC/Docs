Exploring the example game is the best way to get started with BlueDragon software.
This guide will break down the [main class](https://github.com/BlueDragonMC/ExampleGame/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/com/bluedragonmc/games/examplegame/ExampleGame.kt)
and the necessary [configuration file](https://github.com/BlueDragonMC/ExampleGame/blob/main/src/main/resources/game.properties).

## Configuration File

```properties
# The game.properties file defines the game's main class (which extends com.bluedragonmc.server.Game)
# It is used by the plugin loader to determine which class to instantiate when a game is requested.
# The name is also used to populate menus and command completion.
name=ExampleGame
main-class=com.bluedragonmc.games.examplegame.ExampleGame
```

This file must be named `game.properties` and be placed in the root of the compiled JAR file.
Only one game can be registered per JAR. If you wish to combine multiple games into one project, we recommend using [Gradle subprojects](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html).

## Anatomy of the Main Class

There are only two requirements for a game's main class:

- It must inherit `com.bluedragonmc.server.Game`
- It must override the `initialize` method

Here is an example main class from our ExampleGame project:

```kotlin
class ExampleGame(mapName: String) : Game(name = "ExampleGame", mapName = mapName) {

    override fun initialize() {
        use(VoidDeathModule(threshold = 0.0))
        use(CountdownModule(threshold = 2, countdownSeconds = 5))
        use(MyModule()) { myModuleInstance ->
            myModuleInstance.sayHello()
        }
        use(WinModule())
        use(AnvilFileMapProviderModule(Paths.get("worlds/$name/$mapName")))
        use(SharedInstanceModule())

        handleEvent<PlayerChatEvent> { event ->
            event.player.exp += 10
        }
    }

    @DependsOn(WinModule::class)
    class MyModule : GameModule() {

        override fun initialize(parent: Game, eventNode: EventNode<Event>) {
            eventNode.addListener(PlayerSpawnEvent::class.java) { event ->
                event.player.sendMessage(Component.text("Hello, world!", NamedTextColor.AQUA))
            }
            
            eventNode.addListener(PlayerStartSneakingEvent::class.java) { event ->
                parent.getModule<WinModule>().declareWinner(event.player)
            }
        }

        fun sayHello() {
            logger.info("Hello, world!")
        }

        override fun deinitialize() { }
    }
}
```

## Let's break this down!

### The class declaration
```kotlin
class ExampleGame(mapName: String) 
  : Game(name = "ExampleGame", mapName = mapName) {
```

Every game needs to extend BlueDragon's `Game` class.
When overriding the constructor, we recommend keeping the game name (the `name` constructor parameter) constant.

Your constructor is called in different ways depending on the number of parameters it accepts:

| # of Parameters Accepted | Roles of Constructor Parameters |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| 0                        | Called with no parameters.      |
| 1                        | Map name                        |
| 2                        | Map name, Game mode             |

*This logic can be found [here](https://github.com/BlueDragonMC/Server/blob/0f15339656e3755447afcd05bad50d9408399d86/src/main/kotlin/com/bluedragonmc/server/queue/GameLoader.kt#L62-L66).*

The game mode can be any arbitrary string. The Game implementation can use the game mode string to change various game mechanics.

### The `initialize` method

```kotlin
override fun initialize() {
        use(VoidDeathModule(threshold = 0.0))
        use(CountdownModule(threshold = 2, countdownSeconds = 5))
        ...
}
```

The `initialize` method is the time to use game modules. In this example, we're using the [VoidDeathModule](/modules/voiddeathmodule) and the [CountdownModule](/modules/countdownmodule).

Each module should have a [single purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) and ideally shouldn't contain much code.
They are designed to be easy to use in many games without much adjustment.

### The module registration callback

```kotlin
use(MyModule()) { myModuleInstance ->
  myModuleInstance.sayHello()
}
```

If a module has dependencies, calling `use` may not initialize it right away.
Trying to get an instance of a module immediately after usage is not considered safe, since the module
may be waiting for its dependencies to load (and therefore hasn't registered itself yet).

Instead, use the callback option in the second parameter of the `use` method.
When the module is registered, the instance of the module will be passed to the callback.

You can register additional modules in this callback as well, and callbacks can be nested multiple times if necessary.

### Loading maps

```kotlin
use(AnvilFileMapProviderModule(Paths.get("worlds/$name/$mapName")))
use(SharedInstanceModule())
```

Loading maps, just like everything else, is delegated to a module.

- The [AnvilFileMapProviderModule](/modules/anvilfilemapprovidermodule/) loads the map into an [InstanceContainer](https://wiki.minestom.net/world/instances#instancecontainer) and prevents loading the map multiple times into memory.
- The [SharedInstanceModule](/modules/sharedinstancemodule/) uses the `InstanceContainer` created in the `AnvilFileMapProviderModule` to create [SharedInstance](https://wiki.minestom.net/world/instances#sharedinstance)s with the same world content. This allows the map to only be loaded once while keeping players and entities separated.

### Creating a game module

```kotlin
@DependsOn(WinModule::class)
class MyModule : GameModule() {

    override fun initialize(parent: Game, eventNode: EventNode<Event>) {
        eventNode.addListener(PlayerSpawnEvent::class.java) { event ->
            event.player.sendMessage(Component.text("Hello, world!", NamedTextColor.AQUA))
        }
        
        eventNode.addListener(PlayerStartSneakingEvent::class.java) { event ->
            parent.getModule<WinModule>().declareWinner(event.player)
        }
    }

    override fun deinitialize() { }
}
```

You can create your own modules by extending the GameModule class and overriding the `initialize` and `deinitialize` methods.

#### Module Dependencies

Dependencies are specified with the `DependsOn` and `SoftDependsOn` annotations.
If a module lists a dependency, that dependency will be registered before the dependent module is registered.

However, for soft dependencies, if the dependency is not registered by the time `initialize` is fully invoked, the module will be registered instead of throwing an exception.

#### Scoped Event Nodes

Every module gets its own EventNode, which is scoped to the game. All events that pass through this EventNode must be related to a player in the game, an instance that this game owns, or the game itself.

_The only exception to this is the ServerTickMonitorEvent. See [the source code](https://github.com/BlueDragonMC/Server/blob/b05b09ad229ccf85da20130510c9c1cdf90bbeed/common/src/main/kotlin/com/bluedragonmc/server/Game.kt#L93-L100) for details._

#### Unregistering Modules

When a module is unregistered (typically after the game ends), each of its modules get unregistered.
At this point, the module's `deinitialize` method will be invoked.
This is one final time to do any cleanup, like closing file handles or database connections or reverting any non-scoped changes.
